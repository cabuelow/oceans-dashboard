## Oceans MEL Dashboard

This repository contains code to create an Oceans Dashboard.

### TODO:

#### Map

-[ ] Change name of basemap layers to Gray Canvas, Street Map, Topo Map

-[ ] Add Ocean basemap. 

-[ ] If these features don't slow down the app,
can you add:

-   MPAs from the WDPA data set (only when countries are selected)

-   Coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, saltmarshes,
    seagrass (when countries are selected)

-   EEZ when countries are selected.

#### Select Region and Country

\-[ ] Have you tried a dropdown menu to save room? Not sure what looks
better.

#### Select Region

\-[ ] The Arctic selection should only show the Alaska Artic -[ ] The
Western Pacific should include Fiji and the Solomon Islands as well
besides PNG and Indonesia

#### Select Country

\-[ ] Alaska should be Alaska only, right now it shows the entire USA.
-[ ] Consider grouping the countries by regions?

#### People/Climate/Nature

\-[ ] Re-arrange tabs to Nature \| People \| Climate 

-[ ] Group
indicators into Seascape Nature Positive Indicator (the ones you have)
and Seascape Core Indicators (to add later) 

-[ ] Not sure about the
regional baseline or targets yet, but country level baseline and targets
for sure

-[ ] Indicators 

-[ ] Could we add tooltips to each indicator
with the definition? Either as a pop-up window or as another column with
the explanation and data source when that specific indicator is
selected. 

-[ ] Graphs 

-[ ] Could we add download graph and download data
feature for the entire panel? 

-[ ] Can we add a roll-over feature where
the data points show as tooltip when the user hoover over the graphs (I
know this wasn't available in ggplot awhile back) 

-[ ] Label target and
baseline lines.
